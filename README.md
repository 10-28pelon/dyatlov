=================

The dyatlov map maker is aimed at displaying a map representation of various wideband shortwave radio receivers available around the world. It is built on top of the Google Maps API.

Inspiration
===========

The original people and interests behind the dyatlov map maker are associated with [priyom.org](http://priyom.org/) and foremost geared towards numbers stations, shortwave utilities and other radio oddities. In reference to this, this map maker is named after the Russian [Dyatlov Pass incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyatlov_Pass_incident) oddity.

These signals of interest span anywhere on the shortwave spectrum, and are not limited to some amateur or broadcast bands for example. This is why the dyatlov map maker targets wideband shortwave receivers.
